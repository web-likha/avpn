// The wheel's geometry, all three measured off days.christou1910.com.
//
// Two numbers define the path a card travels: the chord between neighbouring
// slots (how far apart cards sit vertically) and the drift (how far right a
// card swings as it leaves the slot). The reference runs 14° apart on a 3159px
// rim, which works out to a 770px chord and 93.8px of drift per step. Against
// its ~989px frame that is 0.78 and 0.095 of the stage height, so both are
// expressed as ratios here and survive a change of viewport:
//
//   chord = 2 · RADIUS_RATIO · sin(STEP_DEGREES / 2) = 0.78 × stage height
//   drift = RADIUS_RATIO · (1 − cos STEP_DEGREES)    = 0.095 × stage height
//
// RADIUS_RATIO 3.2 at 14° reproduces both at once. The radius is what sets the
// curvature: a larger one flattens the arc toward a straight vertical line,
// a smaller one makes cards visibly swing in from the side. An earlier version
// of this file took 8.8° on a 5× rim from the Figma file, which matched the
// reference's spacing but only half its sideways swing — the cards travelled
// too straight, and the wheel read as a vertical slider rather than a wheel.
//
// The chord is also a hard ceiling on card height: a card taller than
// 0.78 × stage height overlaps the one queued behind it.
//
// SCALE_FALLOFF is the third: the queued card's bounding box only resolves to
// the card's own proportions if it is scaled to 0.85 as well as turned, so a
// card shrinks by that factor for each step it sits away from the slot. It is
// the depth cue that stops the rim from looking flat.

/**
 * A wheel of cards that turns while the horizontal band it lives in is parked.
 *
 * The panel is pinned inside [data-hscroll-init], so horizontal motion stops,
 * the wheel rotates through its cards, and horizontal motion resumes — a
 * vertical sequence nested inside a horizontal one. The pin is an ordinary
 * ScrollTrigger `pin` aimed at the band's viewport with `horizontal: true`,
 * which is only possible because the band is a real scroll container.
 *
 * Geometry is two rotations sharing one origin. Every card sits stacked at the
 * same point — the slot where the active card belongs — and is rotated about a
 * centre `radius` to its right, which flings card *i* down and slightly right
 * along the rim. The hub then rotates the whole set the other way, lifting each
 * card in turn through the slot. Because the cards and the hub share that
 * origin, no card needs its own offset: `rotation` is the only property written.
 *
 * Card count comes from the DOM, so cards can be added or removed in the
 * Designer without touching this file.
 *
 * Webflow contract:
 *   [data-rotary-wheel-init]   panel inside the track; its width beyond the
 *                              stage is the pin distance, so a wider panel
 *                              means a slower wheel
 *   [data-rotary-wheel-stage]  the pinned, viewport-sized box; it has to sit at
 *                              the panel's leading edge, so the panel must not
 *                              centre it — once pinned, the pin-spacer's
 *                              padding is what supplies the remaining width
 *   [data-rotary-wheel-hub]    positioned at the active card's slot; rotated
 *   [data-rotary-wheel-item]   one per card, all stacked on the hub's origin
 *   [data-rotary-wheel-count]  optional, text set to the number of cards
 *
 * Required CSS — the stacking is structural:
 *
 *   [data-rotary-wheel-stage] { position: relative; overflow: hidden; }
 *   [data-rotary-wheel-hub]   { position: absolute; left: 50%; top: 50%;
 *                               width: 0; height: 0; }
 *   [data-rotary-wheel-item]  { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; }
 *
 * Tunables live on the panel as CSS custom properties so the Designer owns
 * them: --rotary-wheel-step (degrees between cards), --rotary-wheel-radius
 * (rim distance in px; defaults to a multiple of the stage height) and
 * --rotary-wheel-scale (size a card keeps per step away from the slot; 1
 * disables the depth cue).
 * The card nearest the slot carries [data-rotary-wheel-state="active"], so CSS
 * owns how the focused card differs from the ones queued behind it.
