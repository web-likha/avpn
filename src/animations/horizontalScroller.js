/**
 * A horizontal scroll band inside an otherwise vertical page.
 *
 * The band is a real horizontal scroll container, not a translated track. The
 * outer element is given a height equal to the track's horizontal overflow, a
 * `position: sticky` child holds a viewport-sized window over the track, and
 * every frame the viewport's `scrollLeft` is set to how far the page has
 * scrolled into the band. Vertical distance in, horizontal distance out, 1:1.
 *
 * Why a real scroller rather than `gsap.to(track, { x: -distance })` with
 * `containerAnimation`: a genuine scroll position means anything inside the
 * band is driven by an ordinary ScrollTrigger with `scroller` pointed at the
 * viewport and `horizontal: true` — including `pin`, which `containerAnimation`
 * cannot do. That is what lets [data-rotary-wheel-init] park the band and run a
 * nested sequence before horizontal motion resumes. Use `horizontalScrollerFor`
 * to find the scroller from a component nested inside one.
 *
 * The smoothing is Locomotive's, not ours. Lenis already eases `window.scrollY`,
 * so this reads an eased number and passes it straight through; adding a second
 * lerp here would just make the band lag the rest of the page.
 *
 * Webflow contract:
 *   [data-hscroll-init]       outer element — its height is written by JS
 *   [data-hscroll-viewport]   sticky window over the track (see CSS below)
 *   [data-hscroll-track]      flex row of panels, wider than the viewport
 *
 * These three rules have to exist in CSS — they are structural, not styling,
 * and the Designer can't express `sticky` + `max-content` cleanly:
 *
 *   [data-hscroll-viewport] { position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100vh;
 *                             overflow: hidden; }
 *   [data-hscroll-track]    { display: flex; flex-wrap: nowrap;
 *                             width: max-content; height: 100%; }
 *
 * `overflow: hidden` rather than `auto` is deliberate. An element with hidden
 * overflow is still scrollable programmatically, so `scrollLeft` and
 * ScrollTrigger both work — but a trackpad swipe can no longer scroll it
 * directly, which would desync it from the page position that is supposed to be
 * its only input.
 *
 * While the band is active it carries [data-hscroll-active] so CSS can key the
 * desktop-only layout off the same signal the script uses.
