/**
 * Draw Path on Scroll — based on the Osmo Supply resource, wired into this
 * repo's build and generalized to drive more than one line.
 *
 * Scrubs SVG stroke drawing from 0% to 100% across the active SVG's scroll range,
 * with an optional separate SVG for mobile.
 *
 *   [data-draw-scroll-wrap]      configuration scope; one timeline per wrapper
 *     [data-draw-scroll-desktop] SVG used above 768px
 *       [data-draw-scroll-path]  every marked shape in here draws
 *     [data-draw-scroll-mobile]  optional SVG used at/below 767px
 *       [data-draw-scroll-path]
 *
 * Optional per-wrapper overrides, so separate instances can behave differently
 * without touching this file. Each falls back to the upstream default:
 *
 *   data-draw-scroll-start     ScrollTrigger start   (default "clamp(top center)")
 *   data-draw-scroll-end       ScrollTrigger end     (default "clamp(bottom center)")
 *   data-draw-scroll-stagger   seconds between each shape starting, when a
 *                              wrapper marks several (default 0 — all together)
 *
 * Despite the attribute name, [data-draw-scroll-path] works on anything
 * DrawSVGPlugin accepts: path, line, polyline, polygon, rect, ellipse, circle.
 *
 * Two things to know when reusing this:
 *
 *   1. It draws a *stroke*. It cannot animate a fill. To reveal filled artwork
 *      (see the signature demo in index.html) make the drawn shape a stroke
 *      inside an SVG <mask> and put the filled artwork in a masked <g>.
 *   2. Keep each drawn shape to a single subpath. SVG restarts
 *      stroke-dasharray at every `M`, so a shape with two subpaths draws both
 *      from 0% simultaneously rather than one after the other. Join them with a
 *      travel segment, or mark them as two separate shapes and use
 *      data-draw-scroll-stagger.
 *
 * Changes from the resource as published, all required to fit this repo or to
 * support more than one line:
 *
 *   - GSAP and its plugins come from `src/lib/gsap.js` (npm) instead of CDN
 *     <script> tags, so registerPlugin lives there.
 *   - Exported and called from `src/index.js` alongside every other component
 *     instead of self-invoking on DOMContentLoaded. Note it must be called
 *     before initSplitReveal() — see the comment at that call site.
 *   - querySelectorAll instead of querySelector for the drawn shape, so a
 *     wrapper can drive several lines. Upstream animated only the first.
 *   - The matchMedia context is stored on the function and reverted before a
 *     new one is built, so calling init twice replaces its work instead of
 *     stacking a second set of contexts and timelines on the same elements.
 *   - start/end/stagger read from the wrapper, defaulting to upstream's values.
 *
 * The breakpoint, scrub behaviour, per-wrapper teardown and refresh are
 * unchanged.
