// The dial's geometry. STEP_ROTATION is the angle between neighbouring numbers
// on the drum's face. SHIFT_PER_DEGREE converts a number's rotation into its
// vertical offset, as a percentage of its own height — so a number turned -30
// degrees also sits 75% of its height below centre. Tying the two together is
// what makes the type read as printed on a cylinder rather than sliding on a
// flat plane: too little shift and the numbers pile up at the pill's centre,
// too much and they escape the arc before they've turned. The negative sign is
// what puts the incoming number below the outgoing one, so the dial turns
// towards you as you scroll down.
//
// OPACITY_FALLOFF fades a number out over ~1.43 steps, so at any scroll position
// the outgoing and incoming numbers are both faintly present and the active one
// is never quite alone.

/**
 * Scroll-driven number drum for the Key Highlights section.
 *
 * [data-highlight-drum-init] marks the tall scroll track — the section's own
 * height is the scrub distance, and a `position: sticky` child does the pinning,
 * so there is no ScrollTrigger pin here and nothing to fight Locomotive over.
 *
 * Inside it:
 *   [data-highlight-drum-track]   the pill; owns the perspective and the mask
 *   [data-highlight-drum-item]    one stacked number per stat, in DOM order
 *   [data-highlight-drum-title]   one caption per stat, same order and count
 *   [data-highlight-drum-counter] text set to the 1-based active index
 *   [data-highlight-drum-total]   text set to the number of stats
 *
 * Item count comes from the DOM, so stats can be added or removed in the
 * Designer without touching this file.
 *
 * The numbers are scrubbed continuously while the captions are stepped: JS
 * writes transforms every frame for the drum, but only flips one attribute per
 * caption when the active index changes, letting the CSS transition carry it.
 * That split is deliberate — a dial that tracks your scroll 1:1 next to copy
 * that snaps is what sells the thing as physical. Scrubbing the captions too
 * makes the whole section feel like it is being dragged.
 *
 * Tunables live on the container as CSS custom properties so the Designer owns
 * them: --highlight-drum-rotation (degrees between numbers) and
 * --highlight-drum-falloff (opacity lost per step away from centre).
