/**
 * Masked scroll reveal: splits [data-split="heading"] text and slides each
 * piece up from behind a per-line mask as it scrolls into view.
 *
 * [data-split-reveal] picks the granularity — "lines" (default), "words" or
 * "chars".
 *
 * [data-split-start] sets when it fires, in ScrollTrigger's
 * "<triggerPoint> <viewportPoint>" syntax — e.g. "bottom 50%" (trigger's
 * bottom edge reaches the middle of the viewport), "top 60%", "center center".
 * Defaults to "clamp(top 80%)". Wrapping in clamp() keeps the start from
 * resolving above the top of the page, which would otherwise let the tween
 * fire part-finished on load; pass a bare value to opt out of that.
 *
 * [data-split-trigger] takes a CSS selector for a different element to
 * measure against (the nearest matching ancestor, else the first match on the
 * page). Useful when the text itself sits in a sticky or transformed wrapper,
 * where its own position is a poor scroll reference.
 *
 * [data-split-once] — "false" replays the reveal every time it re-enters.
 *
 * Uses ScrollTrigger rather than an IntersectionObserver on purpose. A masked
 * element cannot observe itself: IntersectionObserver clips its intersection
 * rect against ancestors' `overflow` AND `clip-path`, so a line parked outside
 * its own mask reports a ratio of 0 forever and never reveals. ScrollTrigger
 * works off scroll offsets and measured bounds, so masking is irrelevant to it.
 *
 * Animating with gsap.from() is also deliberate: the element's resting CSS
 * state is *visible*, and GSAP moves it to the hidden state at init. If the
 * bundle ever fails to load, the text simply sits there unanimated instead of
 * being stranded invisible behind its mask.
